# javalings
Javalings is a project made for learning java by fixing and writing code.
Javalings simplifies the way you check yourself by several simple commands that allow you to check yourself.
The idea of Javalings came after the success of the Rustlings project in teaching the main developer rust. 
Javalings is mainly made for the Joker team to simplify and help the new members learn java and robot code easily.
Here is the link to the filmed lectures in java and robot code filmed by the team members.
